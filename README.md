ot-site example
========

This is a demo of the ot-site code from the [ng-conf talk]() and [related blog post](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/creating-components-p3-angular2-directives).  It's built on top of Pawel Kozlowski's wonderful [ng2-play repo](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play) for Angular 2 bootstrapping.
